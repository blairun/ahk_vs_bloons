*just a scratch text doc/secondary location until an actual issue
in github is created*

# improvements

somehow make the outputdebug print the var name
instead of just being 'upgrading farm'
it says 'upgrading farm3'
**idea** could change instead of each location having
a name and tower type it could be some sort of big object
with map and the id can be the user given tower id/name

need to figure out how to speed up between rounds when
pickup banana path is defined and when one isn't
pickup banana path is really slowing it all down
