-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --- | --- | ---
go | | | | pause | menu | | unpause | debug | reload | temp | cursor

### go

### reload

Stop any/all running scripts and attempt to reload or relaunch the script - implementing saved changes made

### pause

During main 'go' script pause to stop next round from starting

### unpause

Resume 'go' script, starting next round

### menu

Return to main menu from within a map/game *- note - should be used after pause or reload i.e. unadvisable to use while another automation is in progress*

### debug

## Gotchas, Tips, Tricks, Hints, Helps

### Banana pickup

Set pickup points wider than farm locations, setting points to place location misses bananas sometimes, more points on the pickup path increase pickup consistency, find a happy medium, too many pickups cause longer waits at the end of the round slowing down automation
